## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My Main idea is to do a rpg type game where users make choices and at the end they get a score I want to implement random variables with multiple different tasks
Can ge a dataset of nba players and their heights, stats, etc, and when a user inputs some data find the closest plyer to them.
