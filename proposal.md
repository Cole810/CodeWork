# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Survive the Island

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A roleplaying game where it requests inputs from the user and gives you a score based on how well you did.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will prompt the user to what the game is and what type the user needs to do to win. Based on thr prompts I gove the user the user will have to make a decesion based and the corresponding will dictate the score. There will be a random outcome in some choices so each game is not the same. I also plan to have different picture or animations for each stage of the game so it can look more realistic/entertaining. I plan on having 10 different prompts/puzzles with 3 of them having a random component.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A survival role playing game that will input your score based on those decesions with a slideshow implementing 6 different prompts with 2 different random components.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A survival role playing game that will input your score based on those decesions with an animation going along with the story with 15 different prompts and 5 different random variables.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be an entire game that lasts about 10 minutes in gametime and looks something like the walking dead series.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I will have to develop a story and all the different pathways made based on the selections the user makes. Secondally I will have to become more comfortbale with random and how to use that correctly and effectively. I will also have to learn either pygames or renpy to learn how to implement a visual component to the story. After that I will make an outline of the code and debug when needed.
